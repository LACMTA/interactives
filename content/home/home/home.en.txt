----

Text:

July 14th marks the 25th anniversary of the Metro Blue Line, and the rebirth of rail in LA County. In celebrating this milestone, we want to thank all of our riders for their support in building the foundation for LAâ€™s transit future.

With voter-approved Measure R, the years ahead will take LA County transit to new heights, but it stems from the system that has blossomed over the past two and a half decades. Take a look below to explore the history and future of Metro Rail, our blooming map, free concerts and art tours, and more.
